# ArduinoScaling

This project contains code for scaling screen captured content down to a smaller size

I use this to capture Youtube videos, scale them down to 24x15, and display them with my Arduino on an LED matrix.  

The file format I made is very basic, but works fine.  

Configure the config.properties - x and y are the corner of the area you wish to capture.  

outputDataDir=C:/Users/Daniel/Desktop/Programs/data
outputBmpDir=C:/Users/Daniel/Desktop/Programs/bmp
bufferSize=500
x=360
y=159
width=640
height=470
scaledWidth=24
scaledHeight=15


The POV file is for creating POV style animations, which show up on long exposure camera settings.
